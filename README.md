# code-mixing
The present resource is about the automatic identification of English-Italian code-mixing in English historical travel writings about Italy. We release:
* the domain corpus made of travel narratives and guidebooks published between the end of the XIX Century and the beginning of the XX Century. Texts were extracted from Project Gutenberg;
* the data used to retrain and test two state-of-the-art tools for automatic code-mixing: one by [King and Abney (2013)](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~benking/resources/langid_release.tar.gz) - langid [1] - and one by [Schulz and Keller (2016)](https://github.com/sarschu/CodeSwitching)- Code-Switching [2]. 
* the Italian words/expressions extracted from the domain corpus
