# code-mixing
The present resource is about the automatic identification of English-Italian code-mixing in English historical travel writings. We release:
* the domain corpus made of travel narratives and guidebooks published between the end of the XIX Century and the beginning of the XX Century. Texts were extracted from Project Gutenberg;
* the data used to retrain and test two state-of-the-art tools for automatic code-mixing
* the Italian words/expressions extracted from the domain corpus
